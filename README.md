# FruitAnalise
In this project, you must use MATLAB to ensure the quality of the fruit from the farm. This is done by photographing A sample from the production line and comparing this product with a fruit base (in which the type of fruit is introduced in advance) (User chooses in advance) and health and disease parameters on the fetus using color and diameter parameters, etc. (Variables for selected fruits) to confirm the packaging of the product and its marketing throughout the country.
